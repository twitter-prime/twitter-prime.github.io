<h1>The improvement Project</h1><br>
<p>The improvement Project is where we upgrade twitter-prime add the core social media features<br>
For Example, Like following commenting and dmming!</p>
<p>This is because the current one dont have ANY of these core social media features and thing is that the orginial delevopler is made by<br>
samuya bhatt which then i (twitter-prime) cloned this project (because its open source (anyone can have their own version)). Please dont blame us<br>
for this we are trying to add these core features so this might take a few months but it will be done!</p>
